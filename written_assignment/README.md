# Written Assignment - Application Idea

This repository contains my application idea for the written assignment.

## Assignment Description

Describe an original, future application that involves the processing of human language. The application can be on any aspect of natural language processing, for any human language. The essay should be about 500 words long, written in English using your best academic style. It should address the following aspects of the proposed application:

**Motivation**: What does the application do? Who are its intended users, and what problem does it solve for these users? Why is an application with human language processing a good solution for this problem?

**Design**: How does the application work? What are its inputs and outputs? What processes does it use internally?

**Analysis**: What are the limitations of the proposed application? Are there any alternative solutions that could work better, or differently? What would be the implications if such an application were put into use?
