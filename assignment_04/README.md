# CSCI-544 Assignment 04

## Description

Write perceptron classifiers (vanilla and averaged) to identify hotel reviews as either truthful or deceptive, and either positive or negative. You may use the word tokens as features, or any other features you can devise from the text. The assignment will be graded based on the performance of your classifiers, that is how well they perform on unseen test data compared to the performance of a reference classifier.
